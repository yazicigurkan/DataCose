## Setup

First we need to set up a virtual enviroment

  




```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the venv:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```




Then we install the libraries in the requirements file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Runtime

While in the file directory, write the following code on the terminal screen.


  ```bash
    python main.py
```
When we run this code, the operations in the main file will take place. You can see the output in the terminal line.

## Test

While in the file directory, write the following code on the terminal screen.


  ```bash
    pytest test.py -v
```
With the bash code above, you can run the tests in test.py and see the outputs.
